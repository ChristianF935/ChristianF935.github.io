### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
  Lab 1 was my favorite because it marks the beginning of my coding adventure. I didn't know the basics before and the "Hello World" is the famous starting point of coding. This lab taught me that coding isn't going to be an easy adventure.

* Lab 6 Part 1
  Lab 6, part 1 is my favorite because of the silliness with the simple "sandwich" code. The code was not only simple, but also flexible as the code can receive any three inputs and the code still works. Words like "banana", "golfing", and much more single words work.

* Lab 6 Part 2
  Lab 6, part 2 is another contender of being my favorite as the code can calculate the correct scores of blackjack. The code can input the correct answer to any combo, espically with doubles Aces. This code can be pratical to teaching new players on what each card equals.
